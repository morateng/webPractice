        <h1>Chicken</h1>
        <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species
            such
            as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a
            term
            for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a
            capon.
            An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</p>


        <p>Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
            Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
            (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.</p>
